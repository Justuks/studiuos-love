        <h2>Top 10 Romantic Movies</h2>
        <h3>Everyone loves a romantic movie, right?
            Here's what the Guardian and Observer's critics think are the 10 most romantic movies of all time.
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>10 Jules et Jim</h3> Jules et Jim was the biggest box-office success the French New Wave ever
                enjoyed.
                When it opened in Paris in January 1962, it played for nearly three months
                and it found the same crowds all over the world.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>9 A Room With a View</h3>This is incredibly fresh and arresting film-making: moving and amusing,
                swooningly romantic and socially ferocious â€“ nothing less than a full-frontal (in every way) assault on
                your soul.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>8 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>The film's concept is that a couple can delete each
                other
                after a painful break-up so they can live on in blissful ignorance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>7 Hannah and Her Sisters</h3>This 1986 roundelay grossed $40m and became Woody Allen's biggest ever
                box-office hit.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>6 The Apartment</h3> It won five Academy Awards, including best picture, best director and best
                screenplay.
            </li>
        </ul>
